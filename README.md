# License Plate Recognition

**Detect and recognize vehicle license plates using computer vision and Python.**

## Overview
This project implements a workflow to detect license plates in images and recognize the alphanumeric characters.  
It uses image processing techniques and machine learning models to perform **automatic license plate recognition (ALPR)**.

## Workflow
The project follows these steps:

1. **Loading images**  
   - Load vehicle images from dataset or camera input
2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Convert images to grayscale, apply filters, and enhance plate regions
3. **License plate detection**  
   - Detect bounding boxes of license plates using OpenCV or deep learning models
4. **Character segmentation and recognition**  
   - Extract characters from detected plates and classify them using OCR or CNN
5. **Result visualization**  
   - Draw bounding boxes and recognized text on images
